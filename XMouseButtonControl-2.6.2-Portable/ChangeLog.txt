	         pressed (CTRL and scroll is zoom so should not reset when CTRL is pressed,

	#96  Added sticky change movement to scroll action.
	#97  Fixed problem with erratic mouse when left click is reassigned, noticed in Windows 7 snipping tool
	     but I think also related to other eratic reports (like in bug #75)
	#98  Added option to invert horizontal scrolling
	#99  Added option to configure default delays used in simulated keystrokes in the advance settings tab
		 (this is not related to {WAIT}/{WAITMS} tags).
	#100 Converted the application to use Unicode strings internally to support future work to 
	     include language selection.
	#102 Added ability to save/restore Windows 7 desktop gadget positions when saving/restoring desktop icon positions.
	#103 Added option to adjust/specify CPU priority.

    #120 Added Author and Description flags to language pack files so translators can be credited in the GUI.
    #121 Fixed long standing bug with WAIT and WAITMS which were broken in v2.0.
         This has an impact on any simulated keystroke macros. I have introduced {HOLD} and {HOLDMS} tags 
         which allow you to customize specify the time the following key is held down for and reverted WAIT 
         and WAITMS to their previous function of a delay between keys in a sequence.
    #122 Fixed detection of custom window profiles introduced in Beta 10.
    #123 Added new simulated keystroke action: "As mouse button is pressed & when released"
    #124 Add "Same as layer 1" default option for layers 2-5.
    #125 Actions in dropdown are only displayed if applicable to current operating system.
	#126 Fixed bug which prevented activation of profiles if the process name was not all lower case!
	#127 Modified version check to use a DNS query instead of a WWW query, also check for beta updates.
	
	.... Misc performance improvments, debug logging & fixes to new features introduced during the beta stage.
	
	Thanks to everyone that helped in the beta testing of v2.4 and to all those providing language translation packs!

Version 1.46.5: (Internal build)
    Added option to make the mouse scroll wheel scroll the window under the mouse cursor.
    Changed the installation to use the Nullsoft Installer System. 
      This is much faster and means I can have a single (small) distribution for both
      x86 and x64 versions.
    Undone the addition of the {CLEAR} keystroke tag which was not suitable as modifier keys 
      only apply to the following key anyway.
    Modified the simulated mouse button presses to fire a DOWN + UP message in one go, ie a button click.
    Added {WAITMS<n>} simulated keystroke to add a delay specified in milliseconds instead of seconds (with{WAIT<n>})

    Fixed a bug in 1.45 that broke application specific simulated keystrokes.

      to use the settings from Scroll WheelDown instead of its own setting.

      actions like "double click" defined.
    Modifed the code to use XML configuration files instead of the registry.
    Added new Portable mode. In this mode the configuration file (and log) is stored alongside the 
      executable, ideal for running from a USB stick.
      Portable mode is automatically enabled if the application is not in the install location under \program files
