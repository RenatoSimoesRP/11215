In order to use XMBC on newer versions of Windows (7, 8, 2012 etc.), this installer will install a certificate during installation which will allow Windows to trust XMBC and permit UI Access. Without this, some functionality of XMBC will be unavailable (as it is with the portable version).

The author nor anyone else involved in the production, testing or delivery of this software shall be liable to you for any damages of any type.
