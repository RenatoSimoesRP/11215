Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Official) -- October 23, 2014
-------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Mac: The keyboard shortcut COMMAND+N opens a new window when
    the main application window has focus as it did in version 7.2.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when attempting display the information for an
    incorrectly formatted SSH host key.
  - Windows: Selecting the "Update Now" menu item did not reset the
    clock used to check for updates every 30 days.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 5) -- October 2, 2014
----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - In order to prevent potential data loss, merging the personal data
    store with the configuration folder is only done if the session
    structure is exactly the same for both.

Bug fixes:

  - After a session failed to connect because the SSH2 server was not
    available and the session was changed to use Telnet and logon
    actions were added, SecureCRT crashed when attempting to connect to
    the modified session.
  - The previously selected session was not remembered when the session
    manager was closed and re-opened.
  - Windows/Mac: Complex regular expressions used for keyword
    highlighting could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - Mac: The "Connect in Tab" icon in the session manager did not look
    correct on OS X Yosemite (10.10) Retina displays.
  - Mac: The clear button in the session filter edit box was very small
    on Retina displays.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 4) -- September 23, 2014
-------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Windows: Added an "Update Now" menu item to see if a new version of
    SecureCRT is available and if there is, clicking a button downloads
    and installs it.

Changes:

  - The maximum length for a regular expression for keyword highlighting
    was increased to 256 characters.
  - Substitution paramters such as ${VDS_INSTALL_PATH} can be used in a
    script filename.
  - Mac: Since the minimize and zoom buttons were always grayed out,
    they are hidden when SecureCRT is used with the Moom session manager.

Bug fixes:

  - If a regular expression that caused everything to be highlighted was
    specified for a session and the session window was made narrow enough
    for command output to wrap, some words did not get highlighted.
  - If the width of the session manager was resized while it was in
    autohide mode, the new width was not saved when SecureCRT exited.
  - If autohide mode was on for the session manager, then the session
    manager was closed and reopened and autohide was turned off,
    changing any value in the Session Options dialog caused autohide
    to be turned back on.
  - In the Keyword List Properties dialog, if a keyword was selected
    when a new word was added, pressing the "Set Color" button and
    selecting a color caused the previously selected and new keyword to
    be changed.
  - In the Keyword List Properties dialog, after changing the color for
    a keyword, the keyword was not highlighted in the keyword list.
  - Mac: If the Connect dialog was used instead of the Session Manager,
    using the keyboard shortcut COMMAND+I to move focus to the session
    filter box caused SecureCRT to crash.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 3) -- September 9, 2014
------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added a search filter to the Connect dialog, which helps find
    sessions quickly, especially when a large number of sessions have
    been saved.

Changes:

  - The logic used for matching word delimiters was improved so that
    keyword and regular expressions (Windows and Mac only) that
    contain word delimiters do not affect keywords and regular
    expressions that do not contain word delimiters.
  - The order of keywords can now be specified for keyword
    highlighting.
  - SSH2: The modulus for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithms
    can be set from 1024 to 8192.

Bug fixes:

  - Saved passwords could be deleted inadvertently by pressing ENTER
    when focus was in the Password field of the Password Properties
    dialog.
  - When using the filter bar to search for sessions, the session
    tree did not return to the original state if the option "Save
    expanded folder state in connect dialog" was off.
  - Windows/Mac: When more than one rule (e.g., a keyword and a
    regular expression) matched a word, sometimes the word was not
    highlighted using the right color.
  - Windows: Cloned sessions were opened to the right of all sessions
    instead of immediately to the right of the original session.
  - Mac: The keyboard shortcut COMMAND+N opened a new window when
   "Open in a tab" was selected.
  - Linux: SecureCRT crashed if /script was specified on the command 
    line.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 2) -- August 26, 2014
----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - ANSI emulation now supports the CHA sequence (CSI pn G).
  - The keyboard shortcut CTRL+A can be used to select all text in
    the Send String field in the Map Button dialog.
  - In the session manager, when text is entered in the filter bar,
    the first matching session gets selected.
  - Windows: In the session manager, the filter bar can be cleared by
    pressing the ESCAPE key or the "X" button.

Bug fixes:

  - Mac: SecureCRT could crash when sessions were dragged between
    application windows.
  - Mac: SecureCRT crashed if focus was in the filter bar and
    SecureCRT was closed using CMD+Q.
  - Mac: If a three-finger swipe was used to select text in the
    terminal window and then CMD+V was used to paste, the wrong text
    was pasted or pasting was very slow.
  - Mac: Attempting to convert a private key to OpenSSH format failed
    to export the key.
  - Mac: If there was text in the clipboard and the Find dialog was
    accessed using CMD+F, pressing CMD+V caused the text to be  pasted
    in the terminal session rather than the Find dialog.
  - Linux: SecureCRT crashed if the session manager was enabled and
    SecureCRT was closed using ALT+F4.
  - Linux: When sessions were tiled, pressing ALT+ENTER on a session
    in the session manager did not open the session properties dialog.
  - Mac/Linux: In the session manager, if the filter bar was cleared
    after being used to filter sessions, the session tree was not
    restored to its original state.
  - Mac/Linux: Focus could be incorrectly taken out of the connect bar
    when the session manager was automatically hidden.
  - Mac/Linux: The Export Settings and Import Settings dialogs did not
    automatically scroll when the progress information was displayed.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 1) -- August 7, 2014
---------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Windows/Mac: Added support for regular expressions in keyword
    highlighting.
  - Added the ability to specify colors for keyword highlighting.
  - In keyword highlighting, the styles (reverse video, bold, and
    color) can be combined.
  - Added the ability to edit keywords used for keyword highlighting.
  - Added support for exporting and importing SecureCRT settings to
    and from XML, which makes it easier to copy settings from one
    machine to another.
  - Mac/Linux: Added a session manager that can be used in place of
    the modal Connect dialog.  The session manager can be in a pane
    in the SecureCRT window or can be an undocked modeless dialog.
  - Added a search filter to the session manager, which helps find
    sessions quickly, especially when a large number of sessions have
    been saved.
  - Added the ability to connect to a remote system through a named
    pipe.
  - Added the ability to script Kermit file transfers.
  - Added the ability to specify the substitution parameter %USERNAME%
    as a session username.
  - Added a new session option "Position cursor on left click" that
    allows the mouse to move the cursor to a different location.
  - Added a new session option "Enable alternate screen switching".
  - Added an option to disable the hover text for buttons on the button
    bar.
  - Added a new menu item "Close All Sessions" to the tab menu, which
    allows all sessions to be closed without closing the SecureCRT
    window.
  - Added a new global option "Exit SecureCRT when last session is
    closed" that specifies whether or not the SecureCRT window should
    be closed when the last session is closed.
  - Added a global option to swap ENTER and CTRL+ENTER in the command
    (chat) window.
  - Added the ability for the command (chat) window to be controlled
    independently in each SecureCRT window.
  - Mac: Added support for Finder tags.

Changes:

  - Added the ability to store keys larger than 2048 bits in agent.
  - Added the ability to generate keys larger than 2048 bits.
  - When connecting a session, if there's an agent key associated
    with the session, it is tried first.  This can help prevent a
    session from failing to connect because the maximum number of
    authentication retries was exceeded.
  - The MD5 and SHA-1 fingerprints are now displayed in dialogs that
    show host key information.
  - When multiple sessions are being edited, if a single expect or send
    string is changed in the session automated logon option, only the
    single string is changed in all the sessions.  Previously, the
    entire expect/send block was written to the sessions.
  - Added the ability to send a disconnected session to a new window.
  - Log files are saved with a .log extension by default unless a
    different extension is specified.
  - Font information was added to the information stored in the
    personal data folder.
  - Mac: The folder used when a key or button is mapped to
    MENU_LOG_SESSION is the same as the folder used when "Log
    Session" is selected from the File menu.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash if multiple sessions specified the same
    session as a firewall (i.e., jump host).
  - SecureCRT could crash when the send delay "Prompt" option was set
    and a large amount of text was pasted into a session.
  - SecureCRT could crash when several GNS3 sessions were connected in
    rapid succession.
  - SecureCRT could hang if a partial execute escape sequence was
    received.
  - When using mcedit (Midnight Commander editor), incorrect text was
    selected when switching between multiple screens or if the SHIFT
    key was down and the mouse moved, which caused incorrect text to
    be pasted.
  - If a session was resized and then another session was opened,
    the application window was changed to the size before the
    session was resized.
  - When a color scheme that was being used by two or more open sessions
    was changed from the Session Options dialog, only the active tab was
    updated to reflect the change.
  - If a button was mapped to the menu function
    CLEAR_SCREEN_AND_SCROLLBACK, if the SHIFT key was held while the
    button was clicked, only the current session was cleared.
  - If the system resolution was changed while SecureCRT was running,
    the font information in the Session Options dialog did not get
    updated.
  - TAPI: If sessions were copied from one machine to another and the
    the modem in the TAPI sessions did not exist, SecureCRT did not
    indicate that there was a problem when the session was edited and
    displayed a cryptic error when attempting to connect.
  - Windows: Deleting the same session from multiple instances of
    SecureCRT using the session manager could cause all the sessions
    to be deleted.
  - Windows: If the "Black" display theme was being used by SecureCRT
    and RDP was used to connect from another system to the local system
    and then closed, SecureCRT's title bar was missing.
  - Windows: When using the session manager, if the default session
    was changed to include a username and a session was connected,
    SecureCRT prompted for the username.
  - Mac/Linux: SecureCRT could hang or cause 100% CPU usage when the
    terminal protocol was changed.
  - Mac/Linux: If the posix directory was a symbolic link, it caused
    SecureCRT to hang when attempting to open the Session Options
    dialog.
  - Mac/Linux: When specifying a log file for a session, if the
    filter was set to "*.txt", a ".log" extension was used instead.
  - Mac/Linux: If SecureCRT and SecureFX were running and a change was
    made to the global or session options in one of the applications,
    the changes were not picked up by the other application.
