Note that its releaseRepository is trunk. This is so that the 4.5 alpha builds will update from the right place. At release time, this must be changed to 'squeak45'.>>> ReleaseBuilder-fbs.89 <<<Transferring packages to the new update stream requires valid credentials. This lets the release manager transfer things without changing source, and without storing credentials in the image.========== Environments-cwp.7 ==========Environments bootstrap - stage 1
