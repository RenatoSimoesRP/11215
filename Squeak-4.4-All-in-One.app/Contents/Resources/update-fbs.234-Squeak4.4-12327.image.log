========== 45Deprecated-fbs.3 ==========Move ScriptLoader to 45Deprecated.>>> 45Deprecated-fbs.2 <<<The special purpose ReleaseBuilders here. Move all apparently unused instance-side ReleaseBuilder methods here.========== Collections-fbs.517 ==========Separating with whitespace will _always_ work, but at the cost of increased ugliness when not needed. We know that having a binary selector as a key breaks printing, so let's special-case that. At some later stage we might need to revisit these two methods and add further special cases (or just use whitespace).>>> Collections-fbs.516 <<<Surrounding the -> in an Assocation in printed form allows the left side to be a binary selector without things breaking: #* -> #+ otherwise prints as '#*->#+', which is the Symbol #*-> followed by garbage.>>> Collections-ul.515 <<<- a slightly faster (~20%) and simpler (IMHO) implementation of String >> #numArgs>>> Collections-fbs.514 <<<Revert the over-eager (attempt at a) fix.>>> Collections-fbs.513 <<<This fixes the recent report of an Ubuntu 13.04 machine not being able to save a class comment.https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956376========== CollectionsTests-fbs.203 ==========Tests for Collections-fbs.516, showing that an Association can round-trip through #storeString.========== Kernel-dtl.756 ==========Remove Integer>>hex8. This is used only in VMMaker for printing hex representations of 32-bit values. It should be maintained as a VMMaker extension, along with whatever extension may be required for formatted printing of 64-bit values.Add Time class>>primPosixMicrosecondClockWithOffset in addition to primUTCMicrosecondClock and primLocalMicrosecondClock. There are three microsecond primitives that are (or will be) supported on all Cog and interpreter VMs that may be accessed as:{	Time primUTCMicrosecondClock .	Time primLocalMicrosecondClock .	Time primPosixMicrosecondClockWithOffset}>>> Kernel-ul.755 <<<Added two methods to access primitive 240 and 241, which can provide microsecond resolution timestamps on Cog VMs.========== Compiler-nice.263 ==========Revert the halt in Encoder>>litIndex:========== Installer-Core-fbs.368 ==========#sorted: returns a sorted copy of the collection, so don't just throw the copy away.>>> Installer-Core-fbs.367 <<<Use #sorted:.>>> Installer-Core-fbs.366 <<<versionNames is a Set nowadays, but we want to sort it. Hence, convert to an Array.========== System-fbs.527 ==========Move the SmallLand themes/preferences to the SmallLand-ColorTheme package.>>> System-cwp.526 <<<Update Behavior>>allCallsOn to search for references using #bindingOf: rather than #associationAt:. This matches the binding created by the compiler.>>> System-ul.525 <<<Reshaped SpaceTally a bit. It's still messy, but simpler and faster than before. Also fixed the printing part.========== NetworkTests-fbs.36 ==========Verify that we accept an email address with a '+' in it.========== Protocols-fbs.40 =========="a the list" -> "the list".========== ScriptLoader-fbs.337 ==========Move ScriptLoader to 45Deprecated.>>> ScriptLoader-fbs.336 <<<It's better to refer to one's own class through #class: it plays much nicer when someone subclasses you.========== SmallLand-ColorTheme-fbs.2 ==========Move the SmallLand themes/preferences to the SmallLand-ColorTheme package.========== Tests-cwp.202 ==========Use aliases for classes imported with a different name, rather than copying the class binding.>>> Tests-cwp.201 <<<Updated binding tests to ensure that binding identity is preserved whenever possible.>>> Tests-ul.200 <<<- avoid suboptimal string concatentation in ReleaseTest >> #testMethodsWithUnboundGlobals========== Traits-cwp.293 ==========When registering a Trait, catch and resume AttemptToWriteReadOnlyGlobal, since there may already be a class binding.========== TraitsTests-fbs.11 ==========#assert:equals: is much better than #assert:========== ReleaseBuilder-fbs.96 ==========Delete all obsolete ReleaseBuilders. Move the special-case builders - Nihongo, Squeakland - to 45Deprecated. (They're not deprecated as such, but they don't belong in trunk.)========== SystemReporter-ul.21 ==========- addedd SpaceTally to SystemReporter========== Environments-cwp.25 ==========Use aliases for classes imported with a different name, rather than copying the class binding.>>> Environments-cwp.24 <<<Make #asBinding: preserve binding identity whenever possible.
