========== Collections-fbs.519 ==========Mantis issue 7765: Recategorise SmartRefStream conversion methods.http://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id=7765>>> Collections-nice.518 <<<What's the best collection type for holding characters?So, let $A to: $Z collect: as: String	-> 'ABCD...'rather than Array	-> #($A $B $C $D ...)========== PackageInfo-Base-fbs.65 ==========MethodReference new setStandardClass: foo methodSymbol: bar -> MethodReference class: foo selector: bar.========== Monticello-kb.545 ==========MCHttpRepository displays a progress bar, when downloading files from the internet. Before this change the progressbar only appeard after the response started to arrive. Setting the progressbar value to 0 before executing the workBlock displays it immediately, providing better feedback to the user.>>> Monticello-fbs.544 <<<MethodReference new setStandardClass: foo methodSymbol: bar -> MethodReference class: foo selector: bar.>>> Monticello-ul.543 <<<Merged.========== Kernel-cmm.760 ==========- Move #isKindOf: to ProtoObject to allow the PointerFinder to work with Proxies.>>> Kernel-fbs.759 <<<Fix minor typo.>>> Kernel-cmm.758 <<<- Another ticky-tack commit because Monticello-bf.540 did not capture ALL package changes.  The comment for the prior package is wrong, it did not include this change because I failed to:  1) Copy the change text to the clipboard  2) click "Cancel"  3) Find a MC browser.  4) Click "Save"  5) Re-paste the change text.Please see my immediate ancestor for what this change is about.>>> Kernel-cmm.757 <<<- Added convenience methods for creating DateAndTimes relative to now.- When materializing Floats via fromIEEE32Bit:, use the canonicalized 0.0.========== EToys-fbs.96 ==========MethodReference new setStandardClass: foo methodSymbol: bar -> MethodReference class: foo selector: bar.I can't get rid of that deletion from the commit, but it should be harmless: that class doesn't exist anymore.========== Files-cmm.121 ==========- Correct version of asBytesDescription.>>> Files-cmm.120 <<<- Add efficient directory-tree enumeration capability to FileDirectory.- Make #asBytesDescription more terse, and sans any decimal points.========== Installer-Core-cmm.371 ==========- Fix.>>> Installer-Core-cmm.370 <<<Allow any MCRepositoryGroup to be specified as the "repository" from which Installer will install from, employing MCRepositoryGroup default as the default when no other is specified.>>> Installer-Core-fbs.369 <<<Dale Henrich stubbed his toe on this:(Installer url: 'http://seaside.gemstone.com/ss/metacello')    addPackage: 'ConfigurationOfMetacello-dhk.754.mcz';    install.results in the URL 'http://seaside.gemstone.com/ss/metacelloConfigurationOfMetacello-dhk.754.mcz' (note the missing / between 'metacello' and 'Configuration).So when someone leaves off the /, and _specifies a package_, just insert a /.========== KernelTests-fbs.251 ==========Make meaningful error messages.Cool kids categorise conscientiously.>>> KernelTests-dtl.250 <<<Remove AllocationTest>>isSafeVM and related protection for older Unix VMs (prior to 2010) that would crash when running tests. Reference Mantis http://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id=7405 and VMMaker fixes in VMMaker-dtl.143.>>> KernelTests-fbs.249 <<<Basic tests for #ago, #fromNow, compliments of M8R.========== MonticelloConfigurations-ul.113 ==========Merged.========== System-fbs.538 ==========Make #actualClass work in any Environment.Also, #environment must work for any MethoReference already present in the image when this commit lands. Gently and lazily introduce these instances to their host Environment, Smalltalk globals.>>> System-fbs.537 <<<* Pull the big chunk o' code into a block so we can see that we iterate over both instance- and class-side.* Add the #environment accessor I should have added in the last commit.>>> System-fbs.536 <<<MethodReference new setStandardClass: foo methodSymbol: bar -> MethodReference class: foo selector: bar.And the very first toehold of making MethodReference Environmentally friendly.>>> System-fbs.535 <<<Environmentally-aware SystemNavigation didn't look at the metaclass heirarchy, so couldn't find class-side implementors, for instance.>>> System-fbs.534 <<<Move unto MorphicExtras the things that are MorphicExtras. Flaps-referencing methods, in this case.>>> System-fbs.533 <<<More work on make SystemNavigation Environmentally aware. It skirts the issue of what to do with Smalltalk specialSelectors and Smalltalk presumedSentMessages in #allSentMessagesWithout:.My own feeling is that these two might be fine for the "top level" Environment (even though eventually there ought not to be such a thing), but that it's wrong to add these selectors to #allSentMessagesWithout:'s result: a particular Environment might never send these messages.>>> System-fbs.532 <<<SystemNavigation is one of the core parts of how Tools reflect on an image. This modest proposal introduces (partially) a means of making a SystemNavigation reflect on an Environment. It relies on Environments-fbs.27>>> System-fbs.531 <<<Move localization classes/methods to System-Localization.>>> System-fbs.530 <<<This code reshuffle makes it visually much more obvious how Project >> #future:send:at:args: and MorphicProject >> #future:send:at:args: differ. (Hint: not a lot.)>>> System-fbs.529 <<<Another tiny step in breaking the System -> MorphicExtras dependency.

Remove the now empty GetText-Localization system category.>>> GetText-fbs.30 <<<Move localization classes/methods to System-Localization. Remove the now empty GetText-Localization system category.>>> GetText-fbs.29 <<<Fix some grammatical nits.>>> GetText-fbs.28 <<<Only re-initialise during an aggressive cleanup (such as preparing a new release).>>> GetText-fbs.27 <<<Add a #cleanUp so that ReleaseBuilder doesn't have to call #clearAllDomains.========== Morphic-kb.652 ==========Implementation of pre selection highlight in PluggableListMorph.

Note that System always transitively depended on EToys (because System -> GetText -> EToys).Note that the cause of the dependency - TextDomainManager class >> #allMethodsWithTranslations (which uses EToyVocabular) - is only sent from TextDomainManager class >> #updateDomainOfAllMethodsWithTranslations, which has no senders in the core image.>>> Tests-fbs.213 <<<Test that one can load Monticello packages into an Environment.>>> Tests-fbs.212 <<<In keeping with the naming convention, MorphicUIBugTest -> MorphicUIManagerTest.>>> Tests-fbs.211 <<<Flap tests belong in MorphicExtrasTests.>>> Tests-fbs.210 <<<Move RenderBugz to the MorphicTest package.>>> Tests-fbs.209 <<<RenderBugz just piggybacked off MorphicUIBugTest for its cleanup.

After adding senders or implementors of a heavily overloaded selector to a MessageTrace, typically just a few of the messages are relevant out of many.  In that situation, the user need merely select the range of relevant methods to arrive within two key gestures of trimming the irrelevant methods:  1) Command+I (capital eye) to invert the selection within the local group followed by 2) Command+d to remove that selection from the browser.>>> Tools-bf.462 <<<When deleting a changeset, update the changeset list explicitly. Otherwise we get a DNU when deleting from a filtered view. (Possibly this indicates a problem in the filtering code?)>>> Tools-fbs.461 <<<Clean up the "JIT development" flow. On hitting the "create" button in response to a MessageNotUnderstood, NotYetImplemented or SubclassResponsibility,* a MNU prompts the user for a class and category, pushes a stub method onto the call stack and debugs it;* a NYI debugs the context with the #notYetImplemented/#shouldBeImplemented;* a SR prompts the user for a class (between and including the receiver class and the superclass whose method has the #subclassResponsibility), categorises the new method the same as the superclass's, pushes a stub onto the call stack and debugs that stub.In all cases, resumption lets methods _return_ values down the stack.========== ToolsTests-fbs.65 ==========Tests to show MethodReference >> #actualClass working correctly.>>> ToolsTests-fbs.64 <<<In a MessageTrace, selecting the zeroth item (i.e., selecting no item), and then calling #removeMessageFromBrowser will remove the first item in the list.>>> ToolsTests-fbs.63 <<<MethodReference new setStandardClass: foo methodSymbol: bar -> MethodReference class: foo selector: bar.Tests!========== ReleaseBuilder-fbs.98 ==========DependencyBrowser is already initialised in a 4.5 image.>>> ReleaseBuilder-fbs.97 <<<With the corresponding GetText and Test changes, two less package dependencies in the system.========== Environments-cwp.27 ==========Environment refactoring part 1 of 3: Add new instance variables.>>> Environments-fbs.26 <<<I'm not a huge fan of #removeKey: (lack of error handling), but Metacello uses it, and it's part of the expected API for the Smalltalk object.
