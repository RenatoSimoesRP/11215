========== Monticello-nice.533 ==========Correct this bug: it was impossible to remove an instance variable from Compiler/Parser and probably a few other classes, because Compiler was invoked during its own modification.The fix will work as long as those class won't be Trait's composed...========== Kernel-nice.747 ==========Second attempt to fix the fact that ClassBuilder is not cleaning cog VM jitted CompiledMethod cache.Any CompiledMethod used again before the end of newClass recompilation, might be jitted again.Thus the cache must be cleaned up again before final mutation time.This is particularly true of Parser/Compiler and probably some other Kernel objects.Note to the hunters: we use are using bullets of same caliber (primitive 116) to kill the bear.If it ever fails, next will be nuclear weapon (primitive 89), no matter the colateral download slow down which could result.Note about subclasses: since subclasses are mutated first, one could try to exhibit another cache clean-up failure.For example, if one super method of the subclass is used during ClassBuilder mutate:to:.Before crippling the code with more workarounds, I'll wait for an example from third party, as for myself that's enough brain fuck for the evening.>>> Kernel-nice.746 <<<Fix ClassBuilder which previously failed to flush the cache of old CompiledMethod when the class changes of format.This failure to invoke primitive 116 can lead to COG VM crash (a cogit jitted method is not unlinked).This does not affect old interpreter which clear the caches thru primitive 119.It is essential that the newClass points to identity-preserved CompiledMethods of oldClass methodDictionary before recompiling so that primitive 116 be correctly invoked, particularly we must not clear methodDictionary with a MethodDictionary new..>>> Kernel-bf.744 <<<Sanitize Time class>>readFrom: to not read beyond the time.
