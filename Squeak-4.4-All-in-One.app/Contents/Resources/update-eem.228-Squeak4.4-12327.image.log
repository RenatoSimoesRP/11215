(Does not affect squeak/pharo operation, as those packages do not normally contain such characters)========== Kernel-eem.751 ==========Now that the simulation guard is gone from doPrimitive:method:receiver:args:the simulation machinery can avoid stepping into it, allowingthe debugger to debug doPrimitive:method:receiver:args:>>> Kernel-eem.750 <<<Avoid embeddedBlockClosures holding onto theClosureExtractor that created them.Avoid repeatedly calling endPC in embeddedBlockClosures scan.>>> Kernel-eem.749 <<<Less noise in abstractSymbolic sends.
